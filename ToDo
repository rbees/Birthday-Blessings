To Do:

Expand Blessing database to 120 generic blessings.

Build Blessing directory structure to something like


           Spouse- Husband- Generic
                            Provocative
                            BirthOfChildren

                   Wife- Generic
                         Provacitive
                         BirthOfChildren

           Generic - Broken down by 10 year age divisions.
Blessings-
                     Boys
           Children- Girls

           Friends- Male
                    Female

           Parent- Father

           Victim-specific-manually-entered-by-user


Separate the blessings into individual files in the appropriate directory structure.

Modify the script to use the directory structure and pull blessings that are more specific to the victim.

Modify the script to use ncurses or other to build the victims data file.

Enable 'Forward, Reverse, and Random' order of blessings. Currently controlled by the preceding number in the blessing line.

Separate the salutation part of the blessing off from the blessing and bring it back in as a variable.  Then the salutation, currently "Blessed are You HaShem my G0d, King of the Universe" can be altered more easily by the user.

Fix the script to schedule sending automatically.

Interface to manage 'active victims file from larger database of people.

Considering a config.inc file for configuration, but that gets complex and requires even more changes to the file if they decide to change paths from what we predefine.
