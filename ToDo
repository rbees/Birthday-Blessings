To Do:

Send a preliminary text so that the victim can "Opt-In" to receiving the blessings.

Fix the script to schedule sending automatically.

Develop error checking to avoid sending blessing on a Shabbat, and the Hebrew Holidays
and postpone till the next day.

Separate the salutation part of the blessing off from the blessing and bring it back 
in as a variable.  Then the salutation, currently "Blessed are You HaShem my G0d, 
King of the Universe" can be altered more easily by the user.

Expand Blessing database to 120 generic blessings.

Build Blessing directory structure to something like


           Spouse- Husband- Generic
                            Provocative
                            BirthOfChildren

                   Wife- Generic
                         Provocative
                         BirthOfChildren

           Generic - Broken down by 10 year age divisions.
Blessings-
                     Boys
           Children- Girls

           Friends- Male
                    Female

           Parent- Father
                   Mother

           Victim-specific-manually-entered-by-user


Separate the blessings into individual files in the appropriate directory structure.

Modify the script to use the directory structure and pull blessings that are more 
specific to the victim.

Modify the script to allow the user to incorporate their own specific blessings into the mix.

Modify the script to use ncurses or some other more user friendly interface to build 
the victims data file instead of the current victim_gen.sh.

Enable 'Forward, Reverse, and Random' order of blessings. Currently controlled by 
the preceding number in the blessing line.

Interface to manage 'active victims file from larger database of people.

Considering a config.inc file for configuration, but that gets complex and requires 
even more changes to the file if they decide to change paths from what we predefine.
