Hebrew Birthday Blessings Scripts.

The idea for this came from the American tradition of birthday spankings.  In Jewish culture spankings are reserved 
for disciplinary actions, may you never need to so discipline your child with one.  Instead we bless our children 
every chance we get.  So I figured I would see about getting a script that would send one blessing via a text/sms 
message per year of age instead of one swat per year of age.

These scripts are used to send a series of blessings to the "blessed victim".  The script takes the input of the 
"victims" data file as described below.  It takes the victims civil birthday and using hdate converts it to their 
Hebrew birthday.  Then sends one blessing for each year old they are divided up over a twenty four hour period 
starting at sundown.  Sundown is the start of a day on the Hebrew calendar. There can be a couple weeks difference 
between ones civil birthday and Hebrew birthday, ahead or behind, so allow enough lead time to get your details 
worked out.

Pleas DO NOT abuse the power of these scripts to "crapflood" someone's device.  That is not kind.
Showing someone how much you care for their well being is the intent of these scripts.  If you know someone will be offended by receiving these blessings don't send them to them.

NOTE: Some people do NOT have unlimited texting on their devices.  So don't burn up their service with this.
That would not show kindness either.


A special THANKS to Alanon Zander for getting this script started.


First You need to get your own mapquest key from
http://developer.mapquest.com/web/products/dev-services/geocoding-ws 
and place it in the MAPQUESTKEY variable below on line 40 in bless_victims.sh and line 7 in victim_gen.sh
The free version has a 5K per day limit.  This should satisfy any non-commercial user.

The following has been superseded by the script vitcim_gen.sh which will generate the victims file for you.
Run it and answer the questions.  Done ( Currently it just delets an existing victims file before creating
the new one. )

You will need to create by hand a "victims" data file, which must be a comma separated list as described in bless_victims.sh.  There can be not be any empty or blank lines in the file. The "victims" file can contain 
a separate line for multiple victims. 

Carrier List; ONLY use the 'victim-file-entry' column inside the victims file

Boostmobile           bootmobile or boost	   "myboostmobile.com"
Einstein PCS          einsteinpcs or Einstein	   "einsteinmms.com"
All others            unknown             ouputs   "Unable to send blessings.  Unknown Cellular carrier."

Please feel free to add your own carrier if it is not listed above to the list in bless_victims.sh following 
the format in the file. 


File List:

bless_victims.sh	main script
Blessings.txt		blessings database
Readme			this file
send_blessing.sh	script that sends the blessings
ToDo			proposed changes
VictimsExample		victims example file (DO Not Use, make your own)
victim_gen.sh		script to generate victims data file used by bless_victims.sh

Known Dependencies:  hdate (libhdate1), wget, mailutils, SMTP server

One other dependency is the 'mail' command.  It should be on most modern linux systems, but it is, technically, an 
optional install.  That and a SNTP server on the system that mail can talk to. On my Debian system I use the 
instructions here to enable sending mail from the command line.  https://wiki.debian.org/GmailAndExim4

Note that the mail command may require adding the -r switch for use with a regular mail serever, where as 
it causes errors when using exim4 as a local mail server.

There are some paths/data that may need to be altered to reflect your desired system settings.  They are, by 
approximate line #

In send_blessing.sh  62, 64,

In bless_victims.sh  40, 41, 42, 43

In victim_gen.sh 8, 9, 10

As for moving the directories... 3 paths are recommended.  One for the permanent scripts, one for the data file 
and one for the temporary data.  Some might want to install the scripts in /usr/bin for all to use, 
then use "~/BDay" for STORDIR and Temp files might be put in that user's "~/tmp" or in "/tmp/$USER/"  is why I have
them split up that way.  Many set all 3 the same.  Easy to change.  The default has all 3 set to to "$HOME/BDay".



To use: 

Copy these files to some location in your home directory, say $HOME/BDay  Don't forget to adjust the paths described
above if needed for your system.

Make bless-victims.sh, victim_gen, and send_blessing.sh executable

Create the victims data file by either method described above.

Look through the Blessings.txt file adding and/or removing blessings that should be there specific to the victim, 
you wouldn't want to send provocative blessings to your mother now would you.  Each blessing needs to be at a new 
line with a line number followed by a double pipe symbol as in 3||Blessed .....

Run bless_victims.sh

Run the generated file myjobs.sh just prior to sundown to send the text-blessings to your chosen victim on their 
Hebrew birthday.
